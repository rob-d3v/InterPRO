InterPRO ("we," "our," or "application") is committed to protecting your privacy. This Privacy Policy explains how we collect, use, disclose, and protect your information when you use our desktop application for software interface internationalization.

Please read this policy carefully to understand our practices regarding your data and how we will treat them. By using InterPRO, you agree to the collection and use of information in accordance with this policy.

## 2. INFORMATION WE COLLECT

### 2.1 Information you provide directly:
- **Account information**: When you register to use specific features of the application, we collect your name, email address, and other contact information. We use AWS Cognito to manage the user and authentication system. You may also choose to authenticate using your Google account.
- **Donations and points**: If you choose to make donations to support the development of InterPRO, we collect the necessary information to process your financial transaction through EFI BANK, which is used to manage payments via PIX and credit card. We also keep records of the points you accumulate through donations and contributions.
- **Feedback and support**: Information you provide when reporting problems, requesting support, or responding to surveys.

### 2.2 Information collected automatically:
- **Usage data**: Information about how you use the application, including usage statistics, configuration preferences, languages used, and features accessed.
- **Technical information**: Data about your operating system, application version, device identifiers, and other technical data necessary for the proper functioning of the application.
- **Files and processed data**: To provide internationalization services, InterPRO processes files and texts that you choose to analyze using the application.
- **Use of AI features**: When you use advanced AI features, we collect information about the type of request, point consumption, and performance metrics (without storing the processed content).

## 3. HOW WE USE YOUR INFORMATION

We use the collected information to:

- Provide, maintain, and improve InterPRO and its features;
- Process and manage your donations and points;
- Personalize your experience and remember your preferences;
- Send updates, technical notifications, and support messages;

## 4. INFORMATION SHARING

We do not sell, trade, or transfer your personally identifiable information to third parties, except in the following circumstances:

- **Authentication Services**: We use AWS Cognito to manage user accounts and Google for optional authentication, sharing the necessary information for these services to function.
- **Translation Service**: When using the basic automatic translator, texts are sent to the Google Translator API.
- **AI Services**: When using advanced AI features, texts are temporarily processed through our AWS infrastructure that uses Anthropic's Claude API.
- **Payment processors**: To process donations and payments, we share necessary information with EFI BANK, our payment processor for PIX and credit card.
- **Legal compliance**: We may disclose your information when we believe, in good faith, that such disclosure is necessary to comply with a legal obligation, protect our rights, your safety, or the safety of others.
- **Consent**: With your express consent to share specific information.

## 5. DATA SECURITY

We implement appropriate technical and organizational security measures to protect your information against unauthorized access, alteration, disclosure, or destruction. However, no method of transmission over the internet or method of electronic storage is 100% secure, and we cannot guarantee absolute security.

## 6. YOUR DATA AND CONTENT

### 6.1 Processed files and texts
InterPRO temporarily processes the files and texts you choose to analyze to provide internationalization services. These contents are processed locally on your device. By default, we do not collect, store, or transmit the content of your files to our servers, except when:

- It is necessary to provide specific features that you explicitly request, such as automatic translation;
- You use advanced AI features that require cloud processing;
- You choose to share data with our team for technical support purposes.

### 6.2 Basic automatic translation
When you use the basic automatic translation feature, the texts to be translated are sent to the Google Translator API. By using this feature, you agree to Google's terms and privacy policies, available at https://policies.google.com/privacy.

### 6.3 Advanced AI features
When you use AI features for intelligent text collection or advanced translation:

- Texts are processed through our AWS infrastructure that uses Anthropic's Claude API
- Content is transmitted securely and encrypted
- We do not permanently store texts processed by AI
- Only metadata about the transaction (such as timestamp, number of points used, and performance metrics) are stored
- Results generated by AI are returned to your local device and are not retained on our servers

## 7. DATA RETENTION

We retain your personal information only for as long as necessary to fulfill the purposes described in this Privacy Policy, unless a longer retention period is required or permitted by law.

### 7.1 Retention of points-related data
Information related to the donation points system (donation history, point balance, usage history) is maintained as long as you maintain an active account on InterPRO.
